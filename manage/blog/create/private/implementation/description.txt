In a way the blog permissions can be seen as marker permissions. They should be applied in the correct context of course.
Especialy when giving to pseudo roles like $guest, they tend to be marker permissions which is why we make them at the blog level itself
However, this conflicts with the intention to not have marker permissions... but otherwise if you want _a_ public blog (so assign to $guest), all blogs are public?
Could have a specific boolean for "public" or not and have a different endpoint for those blogs with no permissions?
